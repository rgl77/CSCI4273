Compile the code using the following command:
gcc -w webserver.c -o server
run the compilation by:
./server

I have included config file where I declared the port number, directory and, 
file types that server might deal with. 

The main code is written in C. 

No HTTP library is present.

I have used fork() to continue listening clients.
